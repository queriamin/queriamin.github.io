  <p>Hi, I'm Minjeong! I'm an HCI researcher interested in human-centered AI and technology adoption across generations.</p>

## About Me
I am an HCI researcher passionate about designing and evaluating human-centered technologies. My research interests lie in understanding how people interact with technology and how we can make these interactions more intuitive and accessible.

With experience spanning research, design, development, and marketing, I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and human behavior. I have conducted user interviews, designed prototypes, and collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to explore innovative solutions.

In addition to my technical and research skills, I am fluent in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, and French, allowing me to engage with diverse perspectives and global audiences. I thrive in collaborative environments, taking on both leadership and supporting roles to drive projects forward.

Originally drawn to the gaming industry, I became more fascinated by how people form relationships and engage with technology through games, which led me to pursue HCI research.
